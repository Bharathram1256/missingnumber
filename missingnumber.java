// Question 2: Find missing numbers in array -

// Skill Mapping: Basic

// Description: Consider an array with N number of consecutive integers, in which few numbers are missing. Find and list down these missing numbers using Java.

// Sample input: arrNum = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

// Output: 3

// Sample input: arrNum = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14}

// Output: 4, 7, 9, 12, 13
